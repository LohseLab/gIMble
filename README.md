# Workflow

![gIMble workflow](/docs/gIMble.workflow.jpg?raw=true "gIMble workflow")
**gIMble workflow**. `preprocess` (**0**) assures input data conforms to requirements; `parse` (**1**) reads data into a `gIMble`
store, the central data structure that holds all subsequent analysis. The modules `blocks` (**2**) and
`windows` (**3**) partition the data which is summarised as a tally (**4**) of blockwise mutation
configurations (bSFSs) either across all pair-blocks (blocks tally) or for pair-blocks in windows
(windows tally). Tallies may be used either in a bounded search of parameter space via the
module `optimize` (**5**) or to evaluate likelihoods over a parameter grid (which is precomputed using
`makegrid` (**6**)) via the `gridsearch` (**7**) module. The `simulate` (**8**) module allows coalescent
simulation of tallies (simulate tally) based on inferred parameter estimates (either global
estimates or gridsearch results of window-wise data). Simulated data can be analysed to quantify
the uncertainty (and potential bias) of parameter estimates. The results held within a `gIMble` store
can be described, written to column-based output files or removed using the modules `info` (**9**),
`query` (**10**), and `delete` (**11**).

## preprocess
Note: The `preprocess` module has been replaced by `gimbleprep`. Everything else is identical.
The `preprocess` module assures that input files are adequately filtered and processed so that the `gimble` workflow can be completed successfully. 
While this processing of input files could be done more efficiently with other means, it has the advantage of generating a VCF file complies with `gimble` data requirements but which can also be used in alternative downstream analyses.

```
conda install -c bioconda gimbleprep
gimbleprep -f FASTA -b BAM_DIR/ -v RAW.vcf.gz -k
```

Based on the supplied input files:
- `-f` : FASTA of reference
- `-b`: directory of BAM files, composed of readgroup-labelled reads mapped to reference 
- `-v`: compressed+indexed Freebayes VCF file 

the module produces the following output files:

- **genome file** (sequence_id, length) based on FASTA file
- **sample file** (sample_id) based on ReadGroupIDs in BAM files
- **coverage threshold report** for each BAM file
- **gimble VCF file** (see [VCF processing details](#vcf-processing-details))
- **gimble BED file** (see [BAM processing details](#bam-processing-details))
- log of executed commands

After running, output files require manual user input (see [Manually modify files](#manually-modify-preprocessed-files))

### VCF processing details
- MNPs are decomposed into SNPs
- variant sets are defined as
  ```
  - {RAW_VARIANTS} := all variants in VCF
  - {NONSNP}       := non-SNP variants 
  - {SNPGAP}       := all variants within +/- X b of {NONSNP} variants
  - {QUAL}         := all variants with QUAL below --min_qual
  - {BALANCE}      := all variants with any un-balanced allele observation (-e 'RPL<1 | RPR<1 | SAF<1 | SAR<1') 
  - {FAIL}         := {{NONSNP} U {SNPGAP} U {QUAL} U {BALANCE}} 
  - {VARIANTS}     := {RAW_VARIANTS} - {FAIL}```
The processed VCF file 
  - only contains variants from set `{VARIANTS}` 
  - only contains sample genotypes with sample read depths within coverage thresholds (others are set to missing, i.e. `./.`)

### BAM processing details 
- definition of BED region sets
  ```
  - {CALLABLE_SITES}   := for each BAM, regions along which sample read depths lie within coverage thresholds.
  - {CALLABLES}        := bedtools multiintersect of all {CALLABLE_SITES} regions across all BAMs/samples
  - {FAIL_SITES}       := sites excluded due to {FAIL} variant set (during VCF processing)
  - {SITES}            := {CALLABLES} - {FAIL_SITES}
  ```
Resulting BED file 
- only contains BED regions from set `{SITES}` 
- lists which samples are adequately covered along each region

#### Manually modify preprocessed files
+ `gimble.genomefile`:
    + **[Optional]** remove sequence IDs to ignore them in the analyses
+ `gimble.samples.csv` 
    + **[Required]** add population IDs the second column. Must be exactly 2 populations
    + **[Optional]** remove sample IDs to ignore them in the analyses 
+ `gimble.bed`
    + **[Recommended]** intersect with BED regions of interest to analyse particular genomic regions, e.g:  
    ```
    bedtools intersect -a gimble.bed -b my_intergenic_regions.bed > gimble.intergenic.bed
    ``` 
    
## parse
+ reads input data into GimbleStore 
```
gimble parse -v gimble.vcf.gz -b gimble.intergenic.bed -g gimble.genomefile -s gimble.samples.csv -z analysis
```

## blocks
+ The output of this module determines which parts of the sampled sequences are available for analysis.
+ It uses the "callable" regions specified in the BED file and the variants contained in the VCF file to define sequence blocks of a fixed number of callable sites.
+ The blocking of genomic data is controlled by the parameters `--block_length` (number of callable sites in each block) and `--block_span` (maximum distance between the first and last site in a block)
+ Blocks are constructed independently for each sample pair, which ameliorates the asymmetry in coverage profiles among the samples due to stochastic variation in sequencing depth between samples and/or reference bias.
+ Optimal block length will be different for each dataset. The user is encouraged to explore parameter space. 
```
gimble blocks -z analysis.z -l 64
```

## windows
+ Windows are constructed by traversing each sequence of the reference from start to end, incorporating the heterospecific pair-blocks (X) as they appear based on their start positions.
+ The parameter `--blocks` controls how many blocks are incorporated into each window and the parameter `--steps` by how many blocks the next window is shifted
+ `--blocks` should be chosen so that, given the number of interspecific pairs, enough blocks from each pair can be placed in a window. 
```
gimble windows -z analysis.z -w 500 -s 100
```

## info
+ Lists basic metrics about the GimbleStore
+ Computes standard population genetic summary statistics ($\pi$, $d_{xy}$ and $H$ mean heterozygosity) based on blocks sampled between (X) and within species/populations (A and B). For for details see [gIMble_info.pdf](/docs/gIMble_info.pdf)
```
gimble info -z analysis.z
```

## tally
+ Tallies variation for blocks or for blocks in windows into bSFSs
+ The bSFS is a tally of the mutation configurations of blocks which are themselves described by vectors of the form $`\underline{k}_i`$, which count the four possible mutation types found within a pair-block $i$.
+ parameter k-max is the max count per mutation type beyond which counts are treated as marginals. Order of mutation types is (hetB, hetA, hetAB, fixed)
```
gimble tally -z analysis.z -k 2,2,2,2 -l blocks_kmax2 -t blocks
gimble tally -z analysis.z -k 2,2,2,2 -l windows_kmax2 -t windows
```

## optimize
+ Searches parameter space for model parameters under a given model for a given data tally (based on parsed or simulated tallies) using an optimization algorithm with bounded constraints.
+ Given a set of bounds, optimization can be initiated either at the midpoint of the bounded parameter space or at a random start point. 
+ Optimizations finalize after user-defined stopping criteria are met
+ The user can assess convergence of optimizations by consulting the log-file. 
```
gimble optimize -z analysis.z -l IM_BA_optimize -d tally/windows_kmax2 \
    -w -m IM_BA -r A -u 2.9e-09 -A 10_000,2_500_000 -B 10_000,1_000_000 \
    -C 1_000_000,5_000_000 -M 0,1e-5 -T 0,5_000_000 -g CRS2 -p 1 -e 19 -i 10_000
```

## makegrid
+ Computes a grid of parameter combinations for a list of parameters under a given model
+ Pre-computing the probabilities of bSFS configurations in a grid across parameter space is computationally efficient (relative to using an optimization algorithm) and therefore useful when we wish to interrogate data in replicate, i.e. across windows or simulation replicates.
+ Grid searches may be used either for an initial exploration of the likelihood surface (i.e. prior to defining the parameter space across which to run `optimize`), or to fit models to window-wise data.
```
gimble makegrid -z analysis.z -m IM_AB \
    -b 64 -r A -u 2.9e-9 -k 2,2,2,2 \
    -A=200_000,3_000_000,12,lin \
    -B=100_000,2_000_000,12,lin \
    -C 100_000,2_000_000,12,lin \
    -T 4_256_034 -M 0,2.21E-06,16,lin \
    -p 48 -e 19 -l IM_BA_grid
```

## gridsearch
+ Searches a tally or simulation against a grid made with `makegrid`
```
gimble gridsearch -z analysis.z \
    -g makegrid/IM_BA_grid -d tally/windows_kmax2 -p 50
```

## simulate
+ Simulates tallies based on fixed parameters under a model
+ Simulates tallies based on results of gridsearches
```
# based on fixed parameters
gimble simulate -z analysis.z \
    --seed 19 --replicates 100 --windows 11217 --blocks 500 \
    --block_length 64 -a 10 -b 10 \
